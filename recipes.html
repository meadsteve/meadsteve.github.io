        </h2>
        <p>Based on <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/classic-scones-jam-clotted-cream">https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/classic-scones-jam-clotted-cream</a></p>
        <h3 id="scones-ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>340g flour + extra for dusting</li>
        <li>1.5 tablespoons of baking powder (this is because there was no self raising flour)</li>
        <li>85g butter cut into cubes</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of sugar (I often use vanilla sugar)</li>
        <li>Some salt</li>
        <li>175ml milk</li>
        <li>(optional) squeeze lemon juice (for adding to the warm milk)</li>
        <li>(optional) beaten egg to glaze</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="scones-method">Method</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <p>Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Tip the self-raising flour into a large bowl with ¼ teaspoon (note: teaspoon not tablespoon) salt and the baking powder, then mix.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Add the butter, then rub in with your fingers until the mix looks like fine crumbs. Stir in the  sugar.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Put the milk into a jug and heat in the microwave for about 30 secs until warm, but not hot. Add a squeeze of lemon juice, then set aside for a moment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Put a baking tray in the oven. Make a well in the dry mix, then add the liquid and combine it quickly with a cutlery knife – it will seem pretty wet at first.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Scatter some flour onto the work surface and tip the dough out. Sprinkle the dough and your hands with a little more flour, then fold the dough over 2-3 times until it’s a little smoother. Pat into a round about 4cm deep. Take a 5cm cutter and dip it into some flour. Plunge into the dough, then repeat until you have scones. Press what’s left of the dough back into a round to cut out another set of scones (and repeat)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Brush the tops with a beaten egg (I often don&#39;t bother with the egg), then carefully arrange on the hot baking tray. Bake for 10 mins until risen and golden on the top. Transfer to a cooling rack. The sooner you eat them the better.</p>
        </li>
        </ol>

            <span class="recipe-name">Clotted Cream</span>
        </h2>
        <h3 id="clotted-cream-ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Whipping or double cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="clotted-cream-method">Method</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Heat an oven to 80c (lower heat is better than too much)</li>
        <li>Pour cream into an oven proof dish. It should be fairly shallow.</li>
        <li>Put dish in oven for 12ish hours</li>
        <li>Take the dish out of the oven let it cool then cover and put in fridge for another 12 hours.</li>
        <li>When you take it out of the fridge it should be in two layers. A thick creamy butter-like layer on the top (this is the clotted cream) and &quot;milk&quot; at the bottom. It might have a slightly golden skin on top. Skim the very solid clotted cream from the top of the dish and put in jars. I mix the golden skin in with the cream. </li>
        <li>Use the leftover &quot;milk&quot; in other cooking recipes</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="fudge-ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>250g butter</li>
            <li>568ml milk</li>
            <li>1kg sugar</li>
            <li>1 vanilla pod</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="fudge-method">Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cube butter and melt in pan (as big a pan as possible -  it will  bubble up)</li>
            <li>Add sugar once butter is melted.</li>
            <li>Pour in milk once all sugar is in.</li>
            <li>Add a vanilla pod.</li>
            <li>Stir regularly.</li>
            <li>Keep cooking for a long time - it will bubble up a lot - if your pan is big enough then let it bubble up</li>
            <li>Take out vanilla pod once thick </li>
            <li>Heat until firm ball stage (see notes below ) - around 116C if measuring with a thermometer</li>
            <li>Take off heat and stir like crazy for longer than you want to. This step is very important</li>
            <li>Pour into large flat heat-proof container and spread to an even thickness</li>
            <li>Cut into cubes once mostly cooled</li>
        </ol>
