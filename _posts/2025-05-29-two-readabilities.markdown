## Which language is more readable?
As someone who works with a number of languages I often encounter statements that reduce down to the following:

> Go is much more readable than python.

and its opposite:

> Python is much more readable than go.

Somewhat confusingly I agree with both. I recently realised that how I reconcile this seeming contradiction is that the above statements are actually talking about different kinds of readability.
