# Talks

My very scattered and hashed together notes for each of the talks I attended. Listed in no particular order.

## PHP: Under The Hood _by Davey Shafik_
- Useful tool: Vulcan logic dumper. Can be used to dump the generated opcodes representing a php file.
- Interestingly there is no difference in opcodes from calling an actual method and a call to __call() magic.
