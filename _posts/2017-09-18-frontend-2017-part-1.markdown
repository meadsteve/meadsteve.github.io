I stumbled across [hyperapp][repo-hyperapp] recently. It made me realise it's been
a while since I've experimented with front end development so I thought I'd have a go
at building a TODO app (as is tradition). I plan to do this as a series of posts with
the following rules:

1. Javascript - I've played a bit will elm. But I want to see what's possible with js right now.
2. I'll do some research but not much. So the tools will hopefully be current but not bleeding edge.
3. If I get stuck in weird frontend bug hacks I'm hitting eject.
4. I'm not going to css - because reasons.

## Getting something to build
So I'd already picked hyperapp as my starting point. I've also decided this is a good time
to try out jsx. Jsx means I'm going to need to do some transformation. So now we need a build tool to
turn my jsx infused javascript in to old javascript.

Hyperapp has instructions for using webpack as a build chain so I've now
got the following in my stack so far:

hyperapp
jsx
webpack
babel

So to NPM:
```bash
npm init
npm i hyperapp
npm i -D \
  webpack \
  babel-core \
  babel-loader \
  babel-preset-env \
  babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx
```

One thing to note is I've used `babel-preset-env` instead of `babel-preset-es2015`.
This means I'll be able to specify an environment in the future that I want to target.

With the above installed I setup

A `.babelrc` for babel:

```js
{
  "presets": ["es2015"],
    "plugins": [
      [
        "transform-react-jsx",
        {
          "pragma": "h"
        }
      ]
    ]
}
```
and `webpack.config.js` to get webpack building:

```js
module.exports = {
  entry: "./index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.js",
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [{
      test: /\.js$/,
      exclude: /node_modules/,
      loader: "babel-loader"
    }]
  }
}
```
