This isn't going to be a sales pitch for a specific way of working. I believe it makes much more sense for individuals,
teams and companies to figure this out for themselves. Instead I wanted to write about how I've found the last year or
so working in a hybrid remote environment.

## What kind of hybrid have I been doing?

My last contract was working at a company that had tuesdays and thursdays as "office first" days. You were also welcome 
at the office every day of the week. It's also quite important that I mention that I'm very lucky to live on the edge
of a city centre with great bike paths. This means visiting the office only means a 15 minute bike ride for me. I 
suspect my experience would be very different if instead I had an hour long commute.

## The pros of the in-office days
 * Seeing people
 * Change of space
 * Coffee chats
 * Bumping into neighbouring teams

## The pros of the remote days
 * Being flexible with my time means I can get various tasks done around the house.
 * Picking up my son from school takes way less time as I live next door to the school.
 * I live by a lot of nature so I can take my breaks in a really pleasant environment.
 * And the added bonus of the previous point: Swimming in my local lake over lunch.

## Things I didn't expect
 * Still mobbing pairing on zoom even when in office 

## How do I want to work in the future
For future contracts I would absolutely work hybrid again. For the above reasons. I would also consider entirely remote
work. Though I think it would be important for me (and the company) to spend some effort trying to make up for the
missing benefits of in-office work. I'm very hesitant, however, to go for work that would be entirely in the office. 
I'm not convinced there's anything that could make up for what I'd lose on the remote days. As always, I reserve the
right to change my mind on this but I don't think that's likely at the moment.
