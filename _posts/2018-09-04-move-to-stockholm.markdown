In the spirit of adventure, my family and I have decided to move to Stockholm. This 
will be the first time I've worked in a different country (and in fact the first time 
I've lived in a different country).

## What's been easy
The new company I'm moving to, [0+X][website-zero-plus-x], have been great. 
They've provided guidance on all the steps I need to take as an immigrant and even found
me a really nice apartment. 

## What's been fun
* Fika
* [Filmjölk][website-fil]
* [Kanelbullar][website-kanelbullar]
* The amount of open space Stockholm has as a city. 
* [Djurgården][website-djurgården]

## What's been strange
* They are much less afraid of having electricity in the bathroom than in the UK.

* Every possible food item seems to be sweetened as much as possible.

* Apartments, if they have washing machines, will have them in the bathroom. 
Turns out it's just the UK that would put them in the kitchen.

* Talking to people here made me realise a lot of Traditional British dishes have 
really strange names. Leading to the creation of: [british-food-generator.herokuapp.com][website-british-food-generator]

* Self service checkouts are less trusting than in the UK. You have to scan your receipt to open
a gate to leave the shop. Before learning this I may have crashed in to a few barriers.
