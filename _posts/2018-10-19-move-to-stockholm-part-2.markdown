I've now been living in stockholm for over a month. It's very quickly started
to feel like home. In no particular order here are a few things I wanted
to write about.

## Personnummer
Unfortunately there seems to be a long wait for EU citizens to get their personnummer. 
It's the key to many things here and without it I've not been able to sign up for a bank account,
backup my travel card or even sign up to the gym.

## Tyresta
Tyresta national park is amazing. It's a short bus ride south of Stockholm. 

## Dill flavoured crisps
A lot of things appear to be flavoured with dill here. Fortuneatly it turns 
out I really like dill flavoured crisps.

## Nudie Jeans
Although London has some Nudie jeans shops it never occured to me to visit them.
This was a mistake. They are brilliant. All jeans come with free repairs for life.
When they eventually wear out they get recycled.

## Veggie food
The range of choice for vegetarian alternatives here is pretty impressive. A
current favourite of mine is oumph.
