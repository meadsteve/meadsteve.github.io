# 2018-09-04-move-to-stockholm

In the spirit of adventure, my family and I have decided to move to Stockholm. This will be the first time I've worked in a different country \(and in fact the first time I've lived in a different country\).

## What's been easy

The new company I'm moving to, [0+X](https://0x.se), have been great. They've provided guidance on all the steps I need to take as an immigrant and even found me a really nice apartment.

## What's been fun

* Fika
* [Filmjölk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmj%C3%B6lk)
* [Kanelbullar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_roll)
* The amount of open space Stockholm has as a city. 
* [Djurgården](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djurg%C3%A5rden)

## What's been strange

* They are much less afraid of having electricity in the bathroom than in the UK.
* Every possible food item seems to be sweetened as much as possible.
* Apartments, if they have washing machines, will have them in the bathroom. Turns out it's just the UK that would put them in the kitchen.
* Talking to people here made me realise a lot of Traditional British dishes have really strange names. Leading to the creation of: \[british-food-generator.herokuapp.com\]\[website-british-food-generator\]
* Self service checkouts are less trusting than in the UK. You have to scan your receipt to open a gate to leave the shop. Before learning this I may have crashed in to a few barriers.
