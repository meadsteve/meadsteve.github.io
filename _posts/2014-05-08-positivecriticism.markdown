## Problem
Early on in my development life my process went something like this:

 1. Create flawless code that's a beauty to look at and is wonderfully self documenting.
 1. Pass the above code to a code review process to much fanfare.
 1. All the reviewers turn out to be trolls and mercilessly attack my code.
 1. I get defensive. Fight to justify my code and keep everything unchanged.

Now the result of this process is that the final step makes me sad and frustrated. I generally don't want to be sad.
So I wanted to identify what was wrong with the above process and improve  my life (and hopefully my code).

## Potential Causes
Maybe the problem is with step 2? So if I stop participating in code reviews I'll be a happier person?
Whilst this solution might give me the illusion of happiness. I won't learn anything from my fellows and I run the risk of letting through some errors.

So what about step 3? Are all of my co-workers (or open-source contributors) negative trolls?
It seems unlikely that I'm a special hero and only everyone else is a troll so we'll skip this for the moment.

So finally Maybe the problem is with step 4. Should I get so defensive?
Is my defensiveness actually caused by a mistaken assumption in point 1 (and a little bit 3). This seems like a good place to start.
