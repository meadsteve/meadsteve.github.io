Problem
======
Early on in my development life my process went something like this:

 1. Create flawless code that's a beauty to look at and is wonderfully self documenting.
 1. Pass the above code to a code review process to much fanfare.
 1. All the reviewers turn out to be trolls and mercilessly attack my code.
 1. I get defensive. Fight to justify my code and keep everything unchanged.

Now the result of this process is that the final step makes me sad and frustrated. I generally don't want to be sad.
So I wanted to identify what was wrong with the above process and improve  my life (and hopefully my code).
