## picking a version
picked 3 but a lot of 2.7 (including my new job)

## WTFs 
default arguments only loaded once -> but if you default to an empty list (which is mutable)

## package management (pipenv)

## static analysis 
for v3 this looks nice: mypy. Nice syntax for 3 as well.

## testing

## Things I like
Annotations for wrapping functions.
