Recently I was talking to friend about getting new people up and running in software teams. He mentioned some problems
a few new starters had had with an unfamiliar library they'd chosen in one project. This got me thinking about a blog
post I'd read a number of years ago about [novelty budgets](https://shimweasel.com/2018/08/25/novelty-budgets) (
and even more years ago: [choose boring technology](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology)).

## Perspectives on novelty
### Team perspective - the new starter?
### Large companies internal transfer?

## what things can be novel?
### The domain is always new
### Is your language common yet?
### Is that library common yet?
### Are the patterns common yet?

## Changes with time

## When to discuss the novelty? ADRs? PRs?
