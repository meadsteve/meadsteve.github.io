Recently I was talking to friend about getting new people up and running in software teams. He mentioned some problems
a few new starters had had with an unfamiliar library they'd chosen in one project. This got me thinking about a blog
post I'd read a number of year's ago about [novelty budgets](https://shimweasel.com/2018/08/25/novelty-budgets) (
and even more year's ago: [choose boring technology](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology)).
