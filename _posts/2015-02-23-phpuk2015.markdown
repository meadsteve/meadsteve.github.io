Talks
======

## Everything That I Really Needed to Know, I Learned in Rabbinical School - Yitzchok Willroth
Opening keynote. Really interesting take on parts of the talmud applied to software development. TLDR summary: community, mentoring and peers are important.

## Adding 1.21 Gigawatts to Applications with RabbitMQ - James Titcumb
Nice intro to RabbitMQ. Some takeaway points for me:
- AMQP standard so any suitable client library can be used in php.
- In php it's better to open a single connection to Rabbit and then use multiple channels.
- Exchanges can be configured in rabit to route messages in to queues. Has some useful syntax for pattern matching a routing key.
- RabbitMQ provides a [simulator][rabbitmq-simulator] to experiment with how the routing will work.
