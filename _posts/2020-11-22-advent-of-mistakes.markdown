For this year's advent of code I decided to try a new language: [crystal](./2020-11-22-advent-of-crystal.markdown).
I wanted to write about the challenges I've faced writing in a language new to me.

## Frustrating bugs

Here are some of the mistakes I made (often more than once) whilst working with this new language.

### assignment (=) when I meant equality check (==)

### Forgetting constructors are .new

### Overriding a method in the same class :facepalm:

### '' for chars "" for strings

## Non-idomatic Code

The harder thing is the feeling that the code I'm writing is clumsy and not embracing the language yet. I think the solution
here would be spending more time reading Crystal (and probably) ruby code.
