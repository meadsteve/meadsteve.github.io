For this year's advent of code I decided to try a new language: [crystal](./2020-11-22-advent-of-crystal.markdown).
Here are some of the mistakes I made (often more than once) whilst working with this new language. 

## assignment (=) when I meant equality check (==)

## Forgetting constructors are .new

## Overriding a method in the same class :facepalm:

## '' for chars "" for strings
