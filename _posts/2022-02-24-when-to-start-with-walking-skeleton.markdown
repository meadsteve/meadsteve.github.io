TDLR:

If I don't even know that I'll need a web service/whatever I don't worry about a walking skeleton. I hack together anything that takes input and gives output and
helps me explore a concept. That way I don't waste time with infrastructure that I might not need.


If I know I'm definitely going to be deploying an API of some kind then I start with getting a walking skeleton for that kind of API up and running. That way I know 
I'll always be able to deploy my work.
