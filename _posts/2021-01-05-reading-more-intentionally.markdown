This is partly a new year's resolution (although I started in December so ðŸ¤·). I decided I wanted
to make my mindless scrolling on my phone a little more useful. So now when I catch myself scrolling
I ask myself the following:

## Do I have the energy to read at all?
I often find I have 5 or 10 minutes where I don't really have the energy to invest in properly reading something.
This is the time I want to get a little more use from. So if the answer to the question above was `No` then I scroll
various news sources looking for things that are interesting (this is a combination of twitter, rss, hackernews, reddit
and a few other aggregators). Anything I find gets added to my [instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/)
(for a while it was just a trello list). This is relatively easy to do even if I don't have the energy or time.

## Do I have the time/interest to read a book?
If the answer is yes then I switch to the kindle app on my phone and start reading. I've made
sure I've got a couple of interesting books ready.

## Do I have enough time/energy to read "something"?
I can now just pick something from my instapaper. It estimates reading time, so I can pick something that fits
the time I have.

## Has this worked?
So far? Subjectively? Yes. I've spent more time reading interesting articles. I've also 
read a decent amount of a book too. Will this keep up and become a habit? Will I forget?
I don't know.
