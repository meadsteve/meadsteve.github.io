# 2018-10-19-move-to-stockholm-part-2

I've now been living in stockholm for over a month. It's very quickly started to feel like home. In no particular order here are a few things I wanted to write about.

## Personnummer

Unfortunately there seems to be a long wait for EU citizens to get their personnummer. It's the key to many things here and without it I've not been able to sign up for a bank account, backup my travel card or even sign up to the gym.

## Tyresta

Tyresta national park is amazing. It's a primeval forest and it's only a short bus ride south of Stockholm. The middle of the park by the bus stop is quite full of people but once you get a little further out it gets quieter.

## Dill flavoured crisps

A lot of things appear to be flavoured with dill here. Fortunately it turns out I really like dill flavoured crisps.

## Nudie Jeans

Although London has some Nudie jeans shops it never occurred to me to visit them. This was a mistake. They are brilliant. All jeans come with free repairs for life. When they eventually wear out they get recycled.

## Veggie food

The range of choice for vegetarian alternatives here is pretty impressive. A current favourite of mine is \[oumph\]\[website-oumph\] \(and only partially because the name makes me laugh\).
