I'll start with a small disclaimer: teams should mostly just work in whatever way makes them most effective. This will 
likely be different for each group of people and situation. Starting with some common processes and then tweaking them 
regularly is probably the best way to find this for your team. Maybe what I'm about to describe below works wonders for 
your team, in which case you can safely ignore this post.

## I do not like status update stand-ups
With that disclaimer out of the way there's a very specific kind of meeting/process that I do dont like and I feel adds
almost no value to a team (and possibly takes away value). This is the stand-up where you go around the team and 
everyone  says something like:

> Yesterday I worked on super important task X...
> Today I will continue my work on task X...

## Why don't I like this type of meeting?
If I'm really honest: I'm just not that interested in the details of what everyone in the team worked on yesterday (
and will work on today). It feels too much like the purpose of this meeting is to check up on everyone and make sure
they are all busy. It might be important for your manager to make sure you're a valuable amount of busy but it's not 
something I want to spend time on (unless I happen to be your manager).

At best I think this meeting is a waste of time. At worst I think it encourages a culture of policing and justifying
how busy we all.

## Are there some parts I like?
The core idea of sharing what people have worked on is valuable to me. Although I don't want to know exactly how 
people spent their time I do want to know what interesting things the people in my team are working on and what they've 
learnt. But there are better ways of getting this for me. We could have showcases and demos at the end of each piece of 
work. We could have "this week I learnt" meetings where people can share any interesting things they learnt. We could
add (or shrink) "work in progress" limits to encourage pairing and mobbing in the team. Techniques like these focus
on the thing that's important to me: what the team learnt, not how they spent their time.

## What kind of stand-up would I prefer instead?

There are probably a lot of options here. You don't even need to have stand-ups. There's (hopefully) no agile
police who will come and take away your software license for not having them. You could run a trial not having stand-ups
for a few weeks and see what happens. 

The alternative I would probably try out first often gets called "walking the board". With walking the board you
take a look at each piece of work that's currently in progress for the team and discuss what you can do to move it 
forward and what can be done to remove blockers. If each piece of work has an owner it might superficially seem
really similar to the "status update" stand-up but to me the important difference is the focus. With walking the board
you are focussed on what the team can do to get a piece of work completed. I think this encourages everyone to work
together for the team rather than check up on how busy they are. If someone says they are stuck or blocked the whole 
team can come together to help.

So please: think about whether you need this status update or if there's something else you could do instead.
