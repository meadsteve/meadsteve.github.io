Starting Point
======

Superstitions seem natural for humans (disclaimer: this may be a superstition).
For a human starting out thousands of years ago, avoiding the cursed river was probably a good idea.
People swimming in this river often disappeared without trace.
This particular river may have, in fact, been full of crocodiles. Very well hidden crocodiles. Well maybe it wasn't.
Better safe than sorry (for a better more well found explanation see here: [New Scientist: Superstitions evolved to help us survive][website-newscientist-article]).


What does this have to do with development?
======

Recently I've been wondering if it may in fact be healthy to treat Development best practises as superstitions.
This doesn't meant they don't work. It doesn't mean they are harmful.
Though some may in fact be. And relying on many of them blindly almost certainly is.
