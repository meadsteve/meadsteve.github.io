I was lucky enough to go to [AWS re:Invent 2017][website-reinvent] this year (big thanks to my employer [Just Eat][website-justeat]).
At the conference amazon launched their new machine learning enabled camera [DeepLens][website-deeplens] and I got hold of a preview copy.

The obvious next step was to come up with a project to use it. Every year I have a group of friends come over for a pre-christmas dinner. 
For reasons lost to the mists of time the mascot for this event is the humble hammer. I thought it would be funny to hack together
something that captured images of my friends holding hammers. Thus a project was born.
