Last week a friend shared this tweet with me:

{% include tweet.html 
    username="evnsio" 
    text="Completely unscientific and hugely subjective question of the day: what is a sensible number of microservices?" 
    link="https://twitter.com/evnsio/status/1228346035745042433" 
%}

my initial reaction was

{% include tweet.html 
    username="meadsteve" 
    text="I'd always say as few as you can get away with. They are great for solving certain problems but they add deployment/runtime complexity that someone needs to think about. #monolithfirst" 
    link="https://twitter.com/meadsteve/status/1228371819427762177" 
%}

and, after a little more thought, I followed up with

{% include tweet.html 
    username="meadsteve" 
    text="Always 1 less than you need"
