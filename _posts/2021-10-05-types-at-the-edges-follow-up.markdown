A little over a year ago I wrote [Types at the edges in Python]({% post_url 2020-02-10-types-at-the-edges-in-python %}) 
to share a pattern I've been moving towards with my python development. Recently I read [Parse, donâ€™t validate][lexi-lambda-blog-post]
and I think Alexis' blog post does a wonderful job of explaining the concept of "type driven design".

On reflection my post is effectively a technique to start applying this approach to python and do less
"Shotgun parsing".

Alexis' post is haskell focussed, but I think it's a great read for programmers of any language.
