<h2>404</h2>
<p>
    Sorry, this page seems to have become lost. Maybe you wanted one of these:
</p>
{% for post in site.posts limit:2 %}
    {% include post_title_short.html %}
{% endfor %}
<a href='{{ "/full-index/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}'>
    <h3 class="full-index-link" style="margin-top: 0">
        <i class="fab fa-searchengin"></i>
        <span>Complete index by topic</span>
    </h3>
</a>
