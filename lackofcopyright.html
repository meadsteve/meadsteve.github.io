    <h2>Lack of copyright</h2>
    <p>
        Everything on this blog I fully release in to the public domain.
        This means you don't need to ask my permission to re-publish, change, borrow, modify etc. etc.
        You don't even need to attribute it to me or link it back to me (though I would appreciate it).
    </p>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
        Knowledge wants to be free.
        All human discoveries are built on top of what came before and I want to add no barrier stopping this.
        By fully sharing the products of my mind hopefully others can go on and build better things.
        My inspiration (and a better written, more lucid, explanation) for this decision can be found here
