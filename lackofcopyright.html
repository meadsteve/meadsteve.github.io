    <p>
        Everything on this blog I fully release into the public domain.
        This means you don't need to ask my permission to re-publish, change, borrow, modify etc, etc.
        You don't even need to attribute it to me or link it back to me (though I would appreciate it).

    <h2><i class="fas fa-question-circle" style="color:cornflowerblue" aria-hidden="true"></i> Why?</h2>
    <p>
        New knowledge is built on top of old knowledge. Why stop this?<br>
