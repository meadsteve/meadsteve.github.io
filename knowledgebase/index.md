## What

As I learn new things I'll try and document them here in very rough form building up as I go. This will be scrappier and less complete than my blog posts The idea for this section comes from [wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) via my friend's version [knowledge.mathew-davies.co.uk](https://knowledge.mathew-davies.co.uk/).
